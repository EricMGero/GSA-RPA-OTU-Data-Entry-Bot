# GSA-RPA-OTU-Data-Entry-Bot
Public Repository for code related to GSA's RPA-OTU and Data Entry Bot 

The original purpose of this bot was to provide the detailed functional process steps and systems required to automate Overtime Utilities (OTU) input into RWA Entry Tracking & Application (RETA)  for the United States General Services Administration (GSA) Public Building Service (PBS). 

Automating Overtime Utilities processes reduced the amount of time spent inputting associated data into RETA and improved the accuracy of  data and recordkeeping. 

The Overtime Utility process begins when a GSA Financial Management POC receives an email (Work Request/RWA Number W******* has been sent to GSA for acceptance). The OTU requests includes a work request number (WR)  and an Overtime Utility Estimate (OUE) along with a corresponding OUE tracking number. 

A RWA analyst reviews the request contained in the email. Next, the analyst ensures the OUE is linked to the assigned WR number in RETA. If the first four tabs are not complete in RETA, the analyst, communicates with the GSA POC of the information still pending. Once completed,  the analysts starts data entry for the corresponding fields in the following tabs: 5. PBS Information, 6. Authorizing Details, 7. PBS Approval. Once complete and error free, the analysts requests signature from an GSA Approving Official and indicates recipients who will receive the acceptance letter. When signature is complete, RETA automatically submits RWA information to Pegasys and an acceptance letter is sent to all relevant parties.
